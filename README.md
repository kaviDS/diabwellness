# Project: diabwellness

Data analysis at Diabwellness based on the clinical data collected at Karunya Sugalaya Healthcare center by Dr. Sivakumar and his team. The data is anonymized by removing confidential information such as Name, Location, Contact, etc. Various information is collected for each patient during each appointment such as prescriptions, vitals, lab results, and measurements. The primary key to combining and indexing this data is called the NFID (a unique patient ID).

## Goals:

There are three major goals that we are working towards in this project which we think can be converted into value-added services. These goals come with their own challenges and difficulties.

1. Medical drug efficiency
2. Risk stratification
3. Prescription prediction

## How to run:

Analysis in the notebooks can be visualized by running these notebooks: `drug_efficiency.ipynb` and `risk_profiling.ipynb`
